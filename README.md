Last Updated: August 16 2024

Current Version: 0.4

To-Do:
* adding compatibility with pre-existing GP packages (george, tinygp, celerite): the gist is probably to let code read if the kernel function its passed is a certain object (e.g a george kernel object) and let the code run the GPR and CV using that package's methods
* writing a tutorial on how to use code with juypter notebook
* combing through existing code to improve lacking documentation and find more appropriate places to include error messages
* writing more tests: how to write tests for GP_predict, run_CV and plotting functions? 
* add std dev to histogram legend
